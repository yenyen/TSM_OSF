/**
 * This is an example for a Transfer Object, which will be used to send data to
 * the client. Instances of this class will be created from JPA entities, but
 * will not expose all attributes. In this example, we do not want to send
 * salary information to everyone, so we have stripped this information. In some
 * cases, a transfer object may also be used to aggregate properties from
 * several JPA entities.
 *
 * The class must have an empty constructor, as well as getters and setters for
 * properties (this is required for the JAXB marshalling to work properly). That
 * is also why we have the @XmlRootElement annotation at the class level.
